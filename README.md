CS50 is known for its:

* Hands-on and rigorous curriculum
* Accessible teaching approach
* Broad global community
* Open educational resources
* Commitment to inclusivity and real-world skill development

Courses under the CS50 umbrella include:

* CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science
* CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python
* CS50W – Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
* CS50AI – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
* CS50AP – Advanced Placement version for high schools

## About CS50P

**CS50P** focuses specifically on **Python** and is ideal for students with no prior programming experience. Unlike CS50x, which introduces a variety of programming languages and concepts, CS50P zeroes in on Python to develop a strong foundation in computational thinking and problem-solving.
