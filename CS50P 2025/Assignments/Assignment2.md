**CS50P 2025 Trimester**  
**Introduction to Programming with Python**  
**Assignment 2 : Sequence of Instructions, Variable Assignment, Data Type Conversion, `input()` - Coding Questions**

---

### üìù Instructions:

- Attempt **all 10 questions**.
- Use proper syntax and indentation.
- Test your answers in a Python environment.
- Submit your `.txt` file or paste your code into the submission form.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Question 1: Variable Assignment

Assign the following values to variables and print each variable:

- A string `"CS50P"`
- An integer `2025`
- A float `3.14`
- A boolean `True`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Question 2: Data Type Identification

Use the `type()` function to print the data types of the following values:

- `"Hello"`
- `42`
- `3.5`
- `False`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Question 3: Input and Type

Ask the user for their name and age using `input()`, then print the types of both inputs.

**Note:** All inputs from users are initially of type `str`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Question 4: Convert Input Types

Ask for the user‚Äôs age (as input), convert it to an integer using `int()`, and print their age in 5 years.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Question 5: Mixing Types

Write code to demonstrate what happens when you try to add an integer and a string. Then correct the error by converting the string.

**Tip:** Use `int()` or `str()` for conversion.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Question 6: Float Arithmetic

Assign two float numbers and calculate their sum, difference, and product.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Question 7: Boolean Evaluation

Assign `True` and `False` to two variables. Then use `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to combine them in expressions.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Question 8: BODMAS Application

## Write an expression using all arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**`. Use parentheses to control the order of operations.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Question 9: Associativity & Precedence

Explain and demonstrate what happens in this expression:

```python
print(2 ** 3 ** 2)
```

- What will be the output?
- Why?

Write your explanation as a comment.

---

### üîü Question 10: Data Type Table (Code Representation)

Create a dictionary where keys are data type names (`"str"`, `"int"`, etc.) and values are example Python expressions of that type. Then print the `type()` of each value in the dictionary.
