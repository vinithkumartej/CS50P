**Introduction to Programming with Python**  
**Assignment 1: Variables and Data Types - Coding Questions**

---

## Instructions:

Write Python code to solve each of the following problems. Use comments in your code to explain your logic where appropriate. Use the `type()` function where required to display the data type of each variable.

---

### Coding Questions

1. Assign your full name to a variable called `name` and print it. Also, print the data type using `type()`.

2. Create a variable `age` and assign your age as an integer. Print the value and its data type.

3. Create a variable `height` and assign your height in meters (e.g., 1.75). Print the value and its data type.

4. Create a variable `is_student` and assign it a Boolean value (True or False). Print the value and its data type.

5. Create a variable `email` and assign it a sample email address (e.g., "student@example.com"). Print the value and its data type.

6. Create three variables: `x = 5`, `y = 3.2`, and `z = "5"`. Use `type()` to print the data type of each. Then explain (as comments) what would happen if you try to add:

   - `x + y`
   - `x + z`

7. Write a short program that asks the user for their name, age, and whether they are a student (True/False). Store each input in a variable and print the variable values and their types.

8. Create a variable `value = "123"`. Convert it to an integer and a float, then print the results and their types.

9. Write a program that checks the type of the following values using `type()`:

   - `"True"`
   - `True`
   - `"123"`
   - `123`
   - `123.0`
   - `False`

10. Create variables for each of the following:
    - A string with special characters
    - An integer with a negative value
    - A float with more than two decimal places
    - A Boolean set to False  
      Print each value and its data type.
